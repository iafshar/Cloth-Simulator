# Cloth-Simulator
Simulates a cloth with controllable wind speed and direction

Essentially a particle system with particles attached to each other with spring dampers to look like a cloth.
Particles experience forces such as gravity, damping forces, spring forces, and aerodynamic forces.
Program starts by having the cloth "draped" with the particles on the top fixed in position.
Can "unfix" those particles by pressing 'd' causing the cloth to drop because of gravity. Can make them fixed again by pressing 'p'
Can control the wind speed and direction in all 3 axes.
When the top particles are fixed in position, you can also move the cloth in all 3 axes using the keyboard, affecting the aerodynamic forces experienced by the particles.
There is also a ground below the cloth that it can collide with.
